If you are anything like me, you have a ton of contacts in your phone that you haven't connected with in forever... and some you probably don't even remember. This iOS application was created to address that problem and help you rediscover your old contacts.

YoWassup! comes preloaded with several common greetings and allows you to add and remove from the core greeting list as you wish.

Once you are happy with the greeting list, simply click on the "Create Message" button located on the homepage and the app will work its magic. A random mobile contact will be selected from your phone's contact list as well as a random greeting from your custom greeting list and a text message will pop up ready to send with both of these random values popped right in. The rest is up to you!
